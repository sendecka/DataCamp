    "Probability underpins a large part of statistics, where it is used to calculate the chance of events occurring. You'll work with real-world sales data and learn how data with different values can be interpreted as a probability distribution. You'll find out about discrete and continuous probability distributions, including the discovery of the normal distribution and how it occurs frequently in natural events!"
