    "In the editor on the right you should type R code to solve the exercises. When you hit the 'Submit Answer' button, every line of code is interpreted and executed by R and you get a message whether or not your code was correct. The output of your R code is shown in the console in the lower right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "R makes use of the # sign to add comments, so that you and others can understand what the R code is about. Just like Twitter! Comments are not run as R code, so they will not influence your result. For example, Calculate 3 + 4 in the editor on the right is a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also execute R commands straight in the console. This is a good way to experiment with R code, as your submission is not checked for correctness.#"
