    "## Course Description\n",
    "Learning Python is crucial for any aspiring data science practitioner. Learn to visualize real data with Matplotlib’s functions and get acquainted with data structures such as the dictionary and pandas DataFrame. This four-hour intermediate course will help you to build on your existing Python skills and explore new Python applications and functions that expand your repertoire and help you work more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll discover how dictionaries offer an alternative to Python lists, and why the pandas dataframe is the most popular way of working with tabular data. In the second chapter of this course, you’ll find out how you can create and manipulate datasets, and how to access them using these structures. Hands-on practice throughout the course will build your confidence in each area.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress, you’ll look at logic, control flow, filtering and loops. These functions work to control decision-making in Python programs and help you to perform more operations with your data, including repeated statements. You’ll finish the course by applying all of your new skills by using hacker statistics to calculate your chances of winning a bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve completed all of the chapters, you’ll be ready to apply your new skills in your job, new career, or personal project, and be prepared to move onto more advanced Python learning."

Most people live in middle income countries where difference in lifespan is huge between countries; depending on how income is distributed and how it is used.\n",
