### Subsetting NumPy Arrays
# Instructions:
# Subset np_weight_lb by printing out the element at index 50.
# Print out a sub-array of np_height_in that contains the elements at index 100 up to and including index 110.

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Store weight and height lists as numpy arrays
np_weight_lb = np.array(weight_lb)
np_height_in = np.array(height_in)

# Print out the weight at index 50
print(np_weight_lb[50])

# Print out sub-array of np_height_in: index 100 up to and including index 110
print(np_height_in[100:111])


### Your First 2D NumPy Array
# Instructions:
# Use np.array() to create a 2D numpy array from baseball. Name it np_baseball.
# Print out the type of np_baseball.
# Print out the shape attribute of np_baseball. Use np_baseball.shape.

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create baseball, a list of lists
baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)


### Baseball data in 2D form
# Instructions:
# Use np.array() to create a 2D numpy array from baseball. Name it np_baseball.
# Print out the shape attribute of np_baseball.

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print(np_baseball.shape)


### Baseball data in 2D form
# Instructions:
# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball.
# Make a new variable, np_weight_lb, containing the entire second column of np_baseball.
# Select the height (first column) of the 124th baseball player in np_baseball and print it out.

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (2 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the 50th row of np_baseball
print(np_baseball[49,:])

# Select the entire second column of np_baseball: np_weight_lb
np_weight_lb = np_baseball[:,1]

# Print out height of 124th player
print(np_baseball[123,0])


### 2D Arithmetic
# Instructions:
# You managed to get hold of the changes in height, weight and age of all baseball players. It is available as a 2D numpy array, updated. Add np_baseball and updated and print out the result.
# You want to convert the units of height and weight to metric (meters and kilograms, respectively). As a first step, create a numpy array with three values: 0.0254, 0.453592 and 1. Name this array conversion.
# Multiply np_baseball with conversion and print out the result.

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated
print(np_baseball + updated)

# Create numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254, 0.453592, 1])

# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(conversion * np_baseball)


### Average versus median
# Instructions:
# Create numpy array np_height_in that is equal to first column of np_baseball.
# Print out the mean of np_height_in.
# Print out the median of np_height_in.

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create np_height_in from np_baseball
np_height_in = np_baseball[:,0]

# Print out the mean of np_height_in
print(np.mean(np_height_in))

# Print out the median of np_height_in
print(np.median(np_height_in))


### Explore the baseball data
# Instructions:
# The code to print out the mean height is already included. Complete the code for the median height. Replace None with the correct code.
# Use np.std() on the first column of np_baseball to calculate stddev. Replace None with the correct code.
# Do big players tend to be heavier? Use np.corrcoef() to store the correlation between the first and second column of np_baseball in corr. Replace None with the correct code.

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Print mean height (first column)
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Average: " + str(avg))

# Print median height. Replace 'None'
med = np.median(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height. Replace 'None'
stddev = np.std(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column. Replace 'None'
corr = np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:, 0], np_baseball[:, 1])
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))


### Blend it all together
# Instructions:
# Convert heights and positions, which are regular lists, to numpy arrays. Call them np_heights and np_positions.
# Extract all the heights of the goalkeepers. You can use a little trick here: use np_positions == 'GK' as an index for np_heights. Assign the result to gk_heights.
# Extract all the heights of all the other players. This time use np_positions != 'GK' as an index for np_heights. Assign the result to other_heights.
# Print out the median height of the goalkeepers using np.median(). Replace None with the correct code.
# Do the same for the other players. Print out their median height. Replace None with the correct code.

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Convert positions and heights to numpy arrays: np_positions, np_heights
np_heights = np.array(heights)
np_positions =np.array(positions)

# Heights of the goalkeepers: gk_heights
gk_heights = np_heights[np_positions == 'GK']

# Heights of the other players: other_heights
other_heights = np_heights[np_positions != 'GK']

# Print out the median height of goalkeepers. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of goalkeepers: " + str(np.median(gk_heights)))

# Print out the median height of other players. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of other players: " + str(np.median(other_heights)))
